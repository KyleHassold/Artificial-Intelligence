This is a project from Junior year of High School to learn how to use the python library, Keras. I attempted to use the LSTM algorythm in this library to predict the value of Apples stock value. As expected, this did not work out so well, however, a lot was discovered about how Keras works with TensorFlow and how to customize the methods given by Keras.
